-Task 1: Variational Autoencoders (VAE)-
  
  We implement three VAE models with different types of latent spaces: continuous, discrete, and a combination of both.
  We use the MNIST dataset but add random colors to each digit.
  We generate images from these VAE models and visualize their latent spaces.
  We discuss the differences between the models, explain how we control color and digit generation using the latent space, and evaluate the results.

-Task 2: Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-
  
  We implement a Cycle GAN using CNNs.
  We assign predetermined colors to MNIST digits.
  We generate images from the Cycle GAN and show how it can create digits with different colors.
  We discuss and demonstrate the results in our report.
  In both tasks, we provide model details, training procedures, and conclusions in a report. We also submit Python code files for training and evaluation and include trained models with saved weights.

These tasks involve creating and training deep learning models, visualizing their outputs, and analyzing the results in our report.
